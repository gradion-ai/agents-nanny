This seemingly simple requirement quickly becomes complex when you realize you need OAuth flows, token refresh logic, and secure credential storage. Multiply that by every API your agent needs.</p>\n<p>You shouldn't have to build this infrastructure yourself. Connect your agents to 250+ APIs and 3000+ tools with <a href=\"https://modelcontextprotocol.io/\">Model Context Protocol</a> (MCP) and <a href=\"https://composio.dev/\">Composio</a>. Composio handles authorization, remote MCP servers and tool execution, while your application focuses on agentic reasoning and tool usage.</p>", "image": null, "date_modified": "2025-09-12T05:52:24+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "Martin Krasser"}], "tags": ["Agent authorization"]}]}
